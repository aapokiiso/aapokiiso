Mom was visiting me over the weekend and we decided to make a quick visit to Lofoten islands, as they are only a few hours' drive away from Kiruna.

On our way we stopped at Abisko to look at the waterfall.

Once in Norway, the scenery quickly turned majestic.
We were lucky to get an almost clear day on Saturday, whereas on the way back on Sunday the weather was really foggy.

It's interesting to see the different livelihoods here, such as fishing.
Quite the contrast to the mine economy of Kiruna just a few hours away.

Also in contrast to Kiruna, spring is already well underway here, with leaves growing on trees and greenery all around.

We only stayed one night in Lofoten and another one in Narvik, with most of the days filled with driving ðŸ˜…
Nevertheless, it was awesome to even get a glimpse at these landscapes.

Here's Lapporten ("The Lapponian Gate") near Abisko on the way back.

I'm considering going back in the summer bikepacking, but I'm not convinced yet.
There are long tunnels on the way and the small roads seemed quite busy even now when it's out of season.
Perhaps the island of Senja a bit further north might be more suitable for bikepacking.
