Me and my friend Oskar spent two months last spring cycling in South Korea and Japan.

☝️ Here's us at the starting point in Incheon near Seoul

We started out from Seoul, following the renowned Four Rivers cycling path all the way to the southern port of Busan.
From there we took a ferry to Shimonoseki in Japan and wound up a few weeks later in Osaka.
After a ferry ride back to Busan we cycled the East Coast route up to Sokcho in the north, ending our trip back in Seoul a short bus ride later.

☝️ Wild-camping wasn't always a treat due to the weather, but the variation in camping spots was amazing

☝️ Japan was not gentle on our tires, as we totaled close to 10 flats in just two weeks
