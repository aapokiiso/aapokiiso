Now that the university courses are over, I had a bit of time to fulfil something I've been planning to do this whole time in Toulouse: completing the Canal du Midi cycling route from Toulouse to Bordeaux.

<!-- more -->

Actually it's more convenient to complete the route the other way around, since my old Kiruna flatmate Emeline lives in Bordeaux, and I could start from her place on my own schedule without worrying about catching a train back to Toulouse.

The first 80 km or so winded through a national park east of Bordeaux, after which the rest of the route followed the canal route all the way to Toulouse. I posted the detailed routes with some pictures to Strava (below).
