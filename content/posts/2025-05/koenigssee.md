Today with some of the other students at DLR we went on a hike to Königssee, Germany's 3rd deepest (190 m) and arguably most photogenic lake.

The lake is like a Norwegian fjord planted in the middle of the Alps.
The analogy is not too far off, since the lake was created through a similar process of glacial ice grinding away the soft rock until a deep groove formed.

We hiked up the eastern shore which is the more accessible side of the lake, and were soon rewarded by stunning views down to the lake.
We also encountered cows grazing on the mountainside, real Alpine style Milka cows.
One of them had planted itself smack middle of the path and wouldn't budge, so we had to do a bit of a detour around it.

Descending back down to the lake took a bit longer than going up due to the winding path.
The way back to the starting point was also unique, as there's a regular electric boat service from one end of the lake to the other.

The lake is next to the Eagle's Nest, the famous fortified Nazi bunker that nowadays has a scenic hiking path leading up to it. I'll definitely be going back to check that out at some point.
