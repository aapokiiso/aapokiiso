The school semester is over here in Kiruna and the Midnight Sun is shining! ðŸŒ„

I'll still be staying here for some weeks to work on a summer project for [IRF](https://www.irf.se/en/), but in July it's time to return to Finland for a bit before moving to Toulouse, France for the next year of the SpaceMaster program.
