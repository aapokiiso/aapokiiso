Time really flies.
I've been meaning to write a longer post, but writing takes time, and time is something I currently don't have too much of, having started a new job at [TALOS](https://talos-space.de) in September.
However, I wanted to share a few pictures from my time in Munich thus far.

I had am amazing summer doing my M.Sc. internship at DLR, also known as the German Aerospace Center.
DLR is filled with smart and talented people, and I got to work with them on the on-board software for two missions, [CubeISL](https://www.dlr.de/en/rs/research-transfer/mission-projects/cubeisl-1) and [QUBE-II](https://www.dlr.de/en/kn/research-transfer/projects/qkd-quantum-technology-for-secure-communication/qube-ii-quantum-key-distribution-with-cubesat).
If you are one of the like 3 people who'd want to read my internship report / thesis, it's available via the [LTU DiVA portal](https://ltu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1996174).

The DLR campus in itself is a sight to see.
It sits right next to a special airport, with a lot of their research aircraft making daily flights in the area.
Sometimes there were also some military aircraft, presumably on their way to some NATO exercise.

Arguably the most interesting facility on the campus is GSOC, the German Space Operations Center.
This is where they direct the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS) from a Houston-esque control room.

However the gemheart<sup>1</sup> of my DLR internship were the other students.
Simple things, like having lunch at the (somewhat mediocre) DLR canteen, and bigger things, like going for weekend hikes on the nearby Alps, absolutely made my summer.
