In the end of May I got a chance for a long weekend bike trip, thanks to Bavaria's ample religious holidays. I decided to take a regional train (free with the Deutschlandticket) to Passau and make my way through the hilly region of Bayerwald, bordering Austria and Czechia.

On this trip I saw the biggest daily climbs of my life, topping 3000 m on one day and totaling 8500 m overall, almost a full Mt. Everest! I posted the route and pictures on Strava, linked below.
