I've been aiming to slim my bike pack size to get rid of the rear rack and panniers.
In this vein, I just got myself a sleeping mat the size of a soda can, the Therm-a-Rest UberLite, and a light summer quilt, the Cumulus Quilt 150.
These fit snugly in my front fork bag (the Ortlieb Fork-Pack 5.8L), which is insane!

It's going to be really interesting to test these out once the weather warms up.
The Uberlite has a shoddy track record with leaks and punctures, so I'm hoping this one holds up.
The Cumulus Quilt is high quality down, but I'm a bit unsure if it ends up being too cold after all.
On paper, it is as warm as my old sleeping bag (comfort +9C), but due to its much smaller pack size, it is considerably thinner.
