# New website!

I'm changing the website to a more modern tech stack with easier content management tools (static Nuxt 3 with a built-in Markdown CMS module).

It'll take a while to get everything set up and to migrate old content, but due to a deadline with my previous hosting provider I wanted to get the site up and running already this weekend.

Hopefully I'll post more in the future now that I have better tools at my disposal!
