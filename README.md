# Hi! I'm Aapo 👋

I'm a software engineer from Helsinki, Finland, currently living in Munich, Germany.

I previously worked for almost 10 years as a full-stack web developer, building digital commerce and healthcare services.

I recently completed a M.Sc. in Space Technology, and am now working at [TALOS GmbH](https://talos-space.de/), writing on-board software for an upcoming fleet of satellites for wildlife tracking.

I blog occasionally on my website [aapo.kii.so](https://aapo.kii.so).

**Some fun stuff I've done:**

🛰️ Space projects
- [APTAS CubeSat](https://gironspace.org/projects/aptas/) On-board data handling and attitude control software

🚋 Public transport

- [aapokiiso/hsl-congestion](https://github.com/aapokiiso/hsl-congestion) Tram congestion estimation in Helsinki
- [aapokiiso/fillarivahti](https://github.com/aapokiiso/fillarivahti) City bike availability estimation in Helsinki

🚲 Travel blogs

I've done two long tours with my bike. For both of these trips I built a static website that pulls photos out of a Google Photos album and shows them on a map, making it easy to follow along.

- [aapokiiso/toulouse-2024](https://github.com/aapokiiso/toulouse-2024) Towards Toulouse in 2024 (I'm studying there right now)

🤝 Open source

I've contributed PRs to various repositories, most of them to the Magento 2 Open Source ecommerce platform ([listed here](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaapokiiso)).
